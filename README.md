# personal_portfolio_project
Small personal portfolio project created with Django

This website is hosted at pythonanywhere.com servers, at the
http://dbkrelingyahoo.pythonanywhere.com/

Steps to configure pythonanywhere.com

- create an account
- from the main dashboard, fire up a bash emulator console and clone your project from github
- create a virtual env referencing python v3.8 as the python version:

  $ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.8 portfoliovenv

    To access the virtual environment in next visits, enter:

    $ workon portfoliovenv

- run server migrate to create the database for your site:

    $ python manage.py migrate

- install dependencies: django and pillow

  $ pip install django pillow

- from another browser tab, access the pythonanywhere dashboard, and go to 'Web' on the top right corner, and then:

    - Provide the absolute path of your source code;
    - Provide the working directory of the code of your website;
    - Edit the wsgi.py file that the tool provides you (/var/www/dbkrelingyahoo_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py).
        Remove everything from the file except the part for Django (you can then remove the header of the section,
        leaving the imports at the top of the file).
    - change the path (line 6) to the path of your project: path = '/home/dbkrelingyahoo/personal_portfolio_project'
    - change the reference to the settings file on line 10:
        os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'personal_portfolio.settings'
    - set the name of your virtual environment.

- Go to the top of the dashboard and reload your server.

And the last step is to add the website address generated by pythonanywhere to the list of allowed hosts in
your settings.py file. You can do it via github commit or via the pythonanywhere tool. It will be like this:

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['dbkrelingyahoo.pythonanywhere.com']

- Reload the site on the server via Web dashboard in python anywhere.

Note: in order to have all your local Graphical Interface up and running in the server, you have to upload
the database file to github/server as well, otherwise the data will not be there.
